                    <p class="project_card_about"> Every since I was a child I really loved to create and imagine new things. Thinking of new ideas was an outlet and allowed me to express myself in an extremely meaningful way. What encourages me to create art is the people around me. I feel inspired to draw and create illustrations for people to be able to make people happy, laugh, and feel a sense of satisfaction. My artworks are created through the use of digital media: Clip Studio Paint, Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate, Premier, Blender, Maya, and much more. I use digital media as my medium because of its diverse toolsets that allow me to shape my world and ideas in more ways than one. With the use of drawing programs, I create interesting digital illustrations that range from fun and simple to complex and fantastical. With 3D programs like Blender and Maya, I can prototype, bring, and create new ideas through the use of character designs, conceptual designs, and world-building. I enjoy drawing out and exploring ideas from the real world and reflecting on them in a made-up fantasy world. To do that I tone down topics and represent them in a fun and interesting way for entertainment. I want viewers to be entertained in a light-hearted way. The big reason why I create art for entertainment is to lighten the mood because the real world has many serious topics. I believe lightening the mood will allow viewers to reset, reconnect, and influence people positively.</p>

          <h8>Hi I'm Derek Luu and I am an artist studying at San Jose State University. I enjoy creating digital artworks and am able to use a variety of tools like Clip Studio Paint, Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate, Premier, Blender, Maya, and much more. I am still learning and hope to be able to expand my skillset more to help create more visually appealing artworks based through my love of story telling.</h8>
